## Clustering customer reviews and scientific articles 

## Sony Jufri

In this project, I worked with two datasets and three unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means, hierarchical and DBSCAN) to cluster customer travel reviews and scientific articles. Different data preprocessing techniques (normalization, text data preprocessing and Principal Component Analysis to name a few) were used to transform the data and each model were evaluated using at least two different evaluation metrics. Lastly, data visualization techniques were used to visualize and explain the results.
